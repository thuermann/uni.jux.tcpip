This is part of a JuX[1] talk held on 12 Jan 1993, about TCP/IP
networking, socket programming, and RPC.

Here is some sample code for TCP/IP client/server code and some slides
about network packet formats.  All other content of that talk was only
on paper and/or the blackboard.

[1] JuX (Joviale Unterweisung in Unix) is a series of talks about Unix
    and related topics, organized by Martin Neitzel at the Technical
    University of Braunschweig.
